### OverView For Project:-
### Navigo 
is a website that creates a learning roadmap for users based on their skill level through a test they take. The site supports seven fields
1. AI & ML
2. web development 
3. Mobile
4. Cybersecurity
5.  Networks
6.  Operating systems
7.  databases

  
It determines each user's level { Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced } and creates a personalized learning path with accompanying resources for each lesson in roadmap.
Navigo  is designed to help people who don't know their level in any of the seven fields, or who don't know where to begin learning a particular field. It provides this group with a roadmap from start to finish, allowing them to retest their progress after completing a level. It also allows them to test themselves in multiple fields simultaneously, displaying a separate roadmap for each field based on their level and test results.
